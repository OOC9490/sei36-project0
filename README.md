# sei36-project0

## About the project
This is a repo containing my first project as a part of GA SEI-36. Other than designing a tic-tac-toe game, I went into the project eager to learn about Canvas which I recently (at the time) looked into and creating at least one browser game derived from the classics. I'll probably continue to add to this project to practice my canvas skills ( and other web development tech), with more classic games!
